Am I the asshole for yelling at my sister that my wedding is not her wedding.
I (29F) am planning my wedding for September of this year. It’s the end of summer and also the month I met my fiancé. My sister, Cat (33F), was supposed to get married five years ago, but her partner died in a motorcycle accident. She was devastated, and had a hard time. Since then, she’s been very gloomy, and her relationships don’t last long. She goes to therapy on and off.
  

  
When I told my family that I was getting married, Cat was visibly sad, so my mom asked me to involve her in the planning and to ask for her opinion to make her feel part of it. However, she didn’t agree with my choice of September, thinking it’s a bad month for a wedding. She also didn’t like the colors I picked or the dress I wanted. I tried to listen to her sometimes.
  

  
At one point, she said, "I can't believe you'll be the first daughter MY (not our) father is going to walk down the aisle." I was gutted by her comment. 
  

  
I’m not having a religious ceremony; my fiancé's best friend got a license to officiate our marriage, so it’s not that serious. With that in mind, I’m planning the wedding to reflect our personalities. My best friend suggested that the bridesmaids wear different colored dresses, but my sister didn’t agree. She made some comments like, "It’ll look like a gay pride parade," and "You’re turning your wedding into a gay wedding by listening to all your of friend’s suggestions." Yes, my best friend is gay, but we have similar tastes, so his opinions are highly valued because they match mine.
  

  
Last week, we were organizing the entrance of our bridesmaids and best men. In our culture, we call them "godfathers/godmothers," and they enter together. I told her that my best friend would enter with his boyfriend. My sister then said my wedding was going to be "an absolute circus" and that, as my older sister, she should make me see reason. She insisted that two men shouldn’t enter the ceremony together because not all guests would understand and appreciate it. Her comments were very annoying and homophobic.
  

  
She continued with her remarks and even called my fiancé to get his opinion. At some point, I was fed up and yelled, "You’re out of line because this is my wedding and not yours. Have your own wedding and plan it as you want." I was very angry, and my mom came from the garden to see what was happening. Cat started crying and went to her room. It’s been five days, and she’s giving me the silent treatment. She told my mom that she won’t be attending my wedding. It’s very annoying; she tries to make me feel uncomfortable. For example, if she’s in the kitchen and I enter, she leaves.
  

  
Yesterday, my mom said I should apologize because my sister is fragile and this topic makes her suffer. However, I don’t think I’m that much of an asshole. My mom said that yelling at her was an asshole move, even if I was right.
