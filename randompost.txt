Today I fucked up and I am now facing the sack for misjudgement in the way I handled a situation at work which snowballed into something far bigger
I posted this same situation in legaladviceUK to. It is based in England.


In THE public work folder, as in the home page which then has sub folders with the work packages in, I found an offer letter PDF for promotion of a girl in my team, it contained salary information and the job title. The promotion was public and written on the white board in the office, the salary is a publicly known and advertised salary.


As there was only one other so far in the office I initiated moving it somewhere buried but still in the public folder before I could report it. I told my colleague what I'd found and was doing and he told me to stop and not touch it, so I stopped and didn't touch it, there was now 2 copies, 1 in the main folder and 1 in a buried folder.


I reported it to the girl that it was in the main folder and completely glossed over there was a second copy, around an hour later I realised the gravity of the situation and realised I'd made a second copy in the public folder, I thought "fuck what do I do now?" And just changed the name of the duplicate file. 5 minutes later I realised that's stupid, and I went back and deleted it and deleted it again from my recycle bin.


To the team, they have records of me copying it, changing the name, then deleting it over the course of 4 or 5 hours. They are telling me I've acted untoward and without truth or integrity and it has breached trust.


 I've tried to explain my thought process but everybody is in self defence mode, especially the management chain that put the document there in the first place to be handled by me as a contractor in such a way. 



TLDR: Found a personal promotion letter with salary in the company wide homepage. I took steps to move it, but abandoned that and inadvertently created 2 copies. I later realised I'd fucked up and went into a self-protection cycle, changed the name of the document and then deleted it.
