Today I fucked up by getting too FU and having one of the embarrassing nights of my life.
On a wonderful date with a beautiful intelligent gal.. We were laughin, shootin the shit, playful teasing. We went to a nice little bar, had a few cocktails. Even the bartenders were like, first date? She's really into you. Love it.   
  
Fast forward to as we are leaving, everything is perfect, second date basically a shoo-in. I was elated. I had mentioned I basically had stopping smoking the herb recently because it was making me a little paranoid and anxious as of late.  But she asked if I wanted to share a joint. I figure, what the hell, wonderful night, she enjoys smoking.. So I join. Next thing I know, I went from a little tipsy to extremely cross faded and fucked up. I walk away to go get water, and go to the bathroom and splash some water on my face. Next thing I know, I'm waking up on the floor in a near empty bar (thank god it wasn't packed). I have never blacked out like that in my life, still not really sure how that happened. Either way, I made a fool of myself. She stayed and made me call a friend or an uber, which I did, but I wanted to just walk away and do it. So I text her this morning to apologize, try to do damage control, and if I didn't fuck up too hard, hopefully see her again. Fuck it. Doubt I'll hear from her again. Wish me luck y'all.

We also have some overlapping social circles, oof.

Too long didn't read: I decided to smoke a little with my date after a perfect date with my dream girl, blacked out and passed out. Probably won't hear from her again
