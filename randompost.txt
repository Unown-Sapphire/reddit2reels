Today I fucked up-Thought I was dying. Told friends and family goodbye forever
This is super embarrassing and I seriously hope none of you make the mistake I made last night. 

I’ve loved psychedelics for years, I’ve had my ups and downs during experiences, but Ive always managed to keep my mental state together enough to differentiate between real issues and perceived ones. 

Last night I attended a show, nothing I’d planned in advance but a group I’ve always enjoyed, nonetheless. I got some boomers off a friend last minute and ate a slice on the ride up there. Within about a half an hour I started having very strange physical symptoms(tingling extremities/chest pain), not ur typical mushroom sensations. I sat myself down and tried to collect myself, after all, I’d taken these booms before. 

Thinking ur going to die on high dose psychedelics isn’t a common thing, but it isn’t all that uncommon either. I just didn’t think this would EVER happen to me.  If I’m dosed that heavy usually texting is out of the question. I have very little recollection of this occurring but I texted everyone(mother, sister, best friends, ex best friends who I wanted to make up with) that I was going to die, “100% tonight”. I texted ex girlfriends who I never really even think about anymore wonderfully abstract poetry saying Goodnight and goodbye, essentially. 

I’m not at all sure why I had the symptoms I had, but apparently they didn’t manifest any further. I didn’t come back to myself enough to realize what I’d done until the car ride back. Now-self pity and embarrassment beyond anything I’ve know .

The only good I see from it is that I actually ended up saying some things to people that I only think I would have said had I honestly thought it was my last sentence to them. Friends. And I guess there’s something to be said about that.

Too long didn't read-I told my family and friends that I was going to die while completely faced.  I’m sure I’ll be confronting this for some time.
