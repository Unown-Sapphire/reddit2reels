Am I the asshole for leaving my friends house after she made me wait me outside for 20 minutes?
Me and my friends usually do get togethers at my friends house since she is the one with the nicest patio/backyard. Two weeks ago we arranged our usual get together and planned on playing board games (nothing too crazy), she told us to come at 7 but since I do not drive and depend on my mom to take me everywhere I was a little late (15min aprox) and forgot to let her know, when I got there I sent her a message letting her know I was there to which she replied "give me 10 min", nothing weird since she has done that before when she's not ready yet. After 15 min aprox I texted her again asking if she could open the door since it was getting windy to which she replies "No, you made me wait 15 minutes so now I'll make you wait 20" I was PERPLEXED, she had never ever done anything like this before and mind you in our culture it's pretty common to arrive a little bit later that the accorded hour (15-20min), by the time she opened the door my other friend was already there waiting for her and she did not make her wait outside like she did with me, I said jokingly since that is how we talk to each other "How unpunctual" to which she replied "Tone it down, Im not in the mood" this was the final straw for me so I told her I was leaving, took an uber home and have not talked to her since, so am I the asshole for leaving and getting mad?
