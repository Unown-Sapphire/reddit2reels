AITA for telling my husband his sisterâ€™s kids are misbehaved?At the start of Covid when things looked bleak and uncertain,  I (47F) bought a bottle of champagne to save for a future occasion. Had not opened it. When asked occasionally by spouse (45M) if I wanted to open it I said no,  I wanted to save it.  This weekend we went on a short trip.  We talked about bringing a bottle of sparkling wine we had just gotten as a gift but I was ambivalent as I had a bad headcold. At the last minute husband tossed a bottle in the car.  Also brought enough hard liquor for a few mixed drinks. We are not big drinkers.  That night he brought out the bottle he brought and I saw it was my special champagne,  not the prosecco wine.  I told him not to open it because I was still saving it. He blew up, called me an idiot for saving it when I didn't have anything in mind to open it for or what future specific reason that I was saving it for and that the whole idea was stupid.  He offered to replace it later (no liquor stores nearby) and I said no,  I'd prefer to save it. He yelled at me some more for being a stubborn jerk and then went ahead and opened it.  He had maybe 4 to 6 oz glass and then stuck the cork in it.  I didn't have any.  I'm still p*ssed and he still thinks I overreacted since he can just buy another bottle.  Thinks are very strained between us as in figuring out how to move forward when I'm still so angry. 
 AITA?
