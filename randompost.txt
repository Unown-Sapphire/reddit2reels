TIFU by Unknowingly Creating a Thanksgiving Pasta Disasterso this just happened like 10 minutes ago. 

about a year ago, someone in a discord server I'm in sent a math challenge that changed per person, so if I got (24/2) + 3, someone else got (27/9) + 4 for example. However that's not the point of this post, but merely to set the scene for what's about to happen. 

so today, I (21m) decided that I was going to cause chaos in a group chat I'm in with my friends (20s m/f). almost all of us are math majors so I figured I'd cause chaos by sending it to the group chat, waiting for people to solve it, and then start flaming each other before I eventually told them what the link was. However, this was not to be. In the year or so since the original challenge, the link must've expired and been replaced with a discord related sex challenge, so when I sent this supposed innocent math challenge to the group chat, the words "Discord sex challenge" appeared instead. The fallout is still going in the chat over this.

and yes, the lesson is learned: check thy links before posting them to a group chat.

TL;DR: Sent what I thought was a math challenge to a group chat filled with math majors to cause chaos. Instead, I sent a discord sex challenge and a different kind of chaos is ensuing.
