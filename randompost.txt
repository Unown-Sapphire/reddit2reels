Today I fucked up by testing to see if anyone in my office actually wanted to talk to me.
It all started at the end of April. I have been at my job for a few years and liked and was well liked by all of my coworkers, or so I thought. 

One day a coworker (Mickie) commented about wanting to go to a baseball game and I jumped at the opportunity. I love baseball and really enjoyed spending time with Mickie; considering her a close work friend after sharing my struggles with anxiety and hearing of her struggles with goings on in her life. This began a string of fucked ups that leads me to today.
 I thought that perhaps she didn't mean to invite me to join her when I asked when she was going and she stumbled over her words. "Oh I hadn't thought about it that much" 
Okay "well let me know when you decide, I'd love to go with you"
 Then and there she looked up game dates and promos and she decided on a weekend game with an alcohol promo. Sweet it should be a great time! I asked if anyone else was going and she invited her cousins to come, the more the merrier!

Everything was great at the game, we had a good time until she got plastered and couldn't get to the toilet without assistance. I wont go into it in detail but Mickie was also getting very snuggly with me as the drinking progressed. I don't have a lot of experience with women to be honest. A highschool romance and a few college flings are all I have to be the judge. To me it seemed that Mickie was coming on to me, strongly. Cuddling, buying me drinks. Asking me to walk with her when she needed to buy food and holding my arm tightly. While at the time I appreciated the affection, I was also quite concerned about the ramifications. Mickie was my friend and we have had discussions which made it clear to me we would not be compatible in that type of relationship. After we had both sobered up I thought to ask her "hey, was all that snuggling just you being drunk and friendly or were was it something more?"

Mickie responded quickly to the text that it was just her being drunk and she was sorry if she gave me the wrong impression or made me uncomfortable. Great! I thought, I never wanted it to be more, but if it was there needed to be serious discussions about it, as she sits directly next to me at work and we're in a small office setting. 

I thought all was well that ended well but after a few days I noticed that Mickie wasn't really talking to me much anymore, I worried that maybe asking her about her behavior had made her uncomfortable around me and so I apologized if that was the case and told her that I missed chatting with her at work. The next day she texted back "I'm just going through some shit right now and don't want to bring it to work with me" 
Okay, no worries, everyone has those times. I guess she just needs some space and will hopefully chat with me when she starts to feel better.
Well the next week she was smiles and roses, chatting with everyone in the office, cracking jokes and asking about people's day to day. Everyone except me, this went on for a couple of days before I texted "hey, I feel like we haven't talked in forever, we should grab a drink and catch up!" The next morning she responded "hey, im sorry I can't go out right now im broke" Okay maybe next paycheck; and I asked again two weeks later, she responded quickly, "I'm sorry, im really not up for it." 

Well shit, I guess she really is still going through it. I continued to give her space but at the end of the week with her chatting away with everyone but me I felt like I needed to apologize for whatever I had done and so I said, 
"I'm sorry for sending this message, and I'm sorry for whatever I did to make you not want to talk to me, I miss our friendship and chats. I know this message may make it worse and I'm sorry for that too" 

"Puzzled, im sorry you feel that way. I don't feel the need to constantly chat at work. But I have to ask you to stop messaging me about this because it puts me in an uncomfortable position"

Oooof

"It's my fault, im sorry. I must've mistook friendliness for friendship" I replyed.

She stopped talking to me in any function other than work related after that day. 
Something about what she said stood out to me. "I don't feel the need to constantly chat" the words repeated in my mind like a CD with a skip. 
Well, I thought, I do tend to chitchat at work. I'm a naturally friendly person and tend to ask questions which keep conversations alive instead of letting them die. I guess I will take queue from her, I will go a few weeks only speaking when necessary or when spoken to. 

I guess nobody at my work likes me, because after a week, I have had exactly 1 person talk to me outside of work questions. I am an anxious, depressed wreck and am currently questioning all my life's friendships. 


Too long didn't read: I lost one work friendship and decided to check them all by only speaking when spoken to, after a week I have had exactly one conversation and am questioning my life.
