Today I fucked up by buying my husband roses. 
Not today but last Friday. While out doing errands I decided to buy my husband roses as a surprise, he buys them for me all the time and thought he might enjoy some in return. When I got home I needed to get everything into the house so I grabbed the grocery bags from the house. Inside one of them was a few random things and a bag of mini donuts. I meant to ask my husband when he got them because I hadn't been to that market in a very long time. I threw everything in the bag onto the counter and continued with my day of picking up the kids from school/daycare, supper and bedtime. He was working until close that night and didn't get home until around 10 pm and I was in the basement by then but told him there was a surprise for him on the counter. A minute later my husband is standing in front of me with a confused and pissed off look on his face, I asked what's wrong. In my busy day I forgot to ask my husband about the mini donuts and he of course thought the donuts were the surprise. I'm going to assume they were from a trip he took with his mom a few weeks ago to check on her property, about 2 hours away and the market is on the way there. Turns out the donuts were moldy and he, somehow, didn't notice that until it was in his mouth. I apologized a million times over. He was very happy for the roses but obviously a little miffed about the taste in his mouth. Maybe I'll just stick to the other ways I treat him from now on. 

Too long didn't read I bought my husband roses as a surprise but he thought the moldy donuts on the counter were his surprise.
