Am I the asshole for not giving my ex wife 25 dollars for a purchase my son accidentally made?
I recently bought my 13 year old son, a Fortnite gift card. Apparently when he was redeeming the card, he accidentally purchased 25 dollars worth of the game credits, using his mothers debit card, which is saved on his computer for whatever reason.
I didn’t find out about it until she text me about 2 hours after the incident, explaining what had happened, and that I now owe her $25. Which, btw, she wanted me to immediately Venmo to her. 
I replied with a few laughing emojis(which maybe I shouldn’t have), and said there was no way I was responsible for him making that purchase on her debit card. She insists that it is my fault, and that I should pay up. Am I the asshole if I don’t pay her the $25?
