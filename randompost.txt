AITA for telling my sister to stop being insecure about her fiancé's bachelor party?
My (28M) sister (30F) is getting married in about a month, and her fiancé (31M), with whom I have a very good relationship, had his bachelor party over this weekend. I was invited, and I hadn’t been to many of those, but it seemed like standard bachelor party stuff to me. We just went pub crawling and ended up in a strip club.

I don’t know what sort of “agreement” future BIL had with my sister about this party, and I didn’t ask. And I certainly wasn’t prepared when my sister texted me today asking me about the party. It started with a simple “how was it?” and eventually it moved to “did he do anything?”. Of course, as her brother, I was the only person she could “ask” (the other guests were his personal friends). But I told her she should stop inquiring me and ask her fiancé if she wants to know anything.

The truth is I didn’t even see him do anything remotely inappropriate (for this context anyway), but just the fact that I didn't want to get involved and refused to say anything made her feel like I was indeed covering for him or something. So when she kept insisting, I just told her to stop being insecure about it.

Apparently that was me crossing the line because she called me up just to say I had no right to judge her like that. I told her that was how she was coming across to me.

Am I the asshole here?
