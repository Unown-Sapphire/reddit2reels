AITA for telling my husband to stop helping my neighbor and her son. 
About five years ago my neighbor Jane kept walking over to our house and sending me messages asking for help for her son to learn to snowboard from my husband. Janes husband wasn’t interested in helping and she kept telling me how great it was that my husband would snowboard with my son. at one point she asked if my husband her and her son could go snowboarding together? I put my foot down and said absolutely not. 

Fast forward a number of years later and her son is now 16. She again asked for help buying a new snowboard and my husband is nice and went and helped her and her son purchase one. She then started texting him asking if she could go with my husband and my son and her and her son snowboarding the next weekend. My husband said that was fine however, my son decided not to go last minute because he wanted to just spend time with my husband.  (My husband didn’t know that but I did) My husband spent the day with Jane and her son even after me telling him that I wasn’t happy about him going and that he should cancel - but he said he already told her he would and didn’t want to flake.

 She texts him during work hours (he replies) and has relentless questions and asking when the next time they can go snowboarding. I told my husband to stop texting her and he can’t go with her anymore. It’s making me uncomfortable.

Note: Her husband is around and did go with them to purchase the snowboard but doesn’t have the time to spend with them on the weekends and so she wants my husband to go to help them and show them the ropes.  He’s one of those people that likes to help others. However - I told him to ghost her. He said it’s gonna be weird when he sees her in the neighborhood and what he supposed to say when he sees her?  I told him to tell her that he’s just too busy.  Am I the asshole?
