Today I fucked up by changing gas suppliers which resulted in me paying for electricity for the first time in 11 years 
This story starts in 2013. I bought a new house in Pennsylvania and signed up for utilities with a local company that combines both electric and gas in one bill. I set up autopay so I automatically pay bills without even looking at them. 

As the years go by, I never look at the actual bill, only once in a while I'm bewildered how cheap my gas and electricity bill is, averaging about $65/month. Maybe two months ago I was talking to my sister who lives nearby about it and she couldn't believe it either. Needless to say I didn't dig deeper and went on my merry way. 

Maybe a few days afterwards I was shopping in Walmart and there was a representative of a competing gas company offering a $15 Walmart gift card for switching my gas supplier. I told him that I don't use much gas anyway so the savings would be minimal but a extra $15 to spend at Walmart never hurt anyone (famous last words). He even tells me that I have 3 days to change my mind before they actually switch me and then I have another 3 months to cancel if I'm not happy. I got my $15 gift right after I finished the sign-up process. 

Today I get an email from my gas and electric company with a much higher total than normal. For the first time I actually look at my bill and compare it to my previous bills and that's when I see it. Before the switch to a new gas supplier I never paid for any electricity!!! I guess the change in my gas supplier made them re-jig the entire account and they finally started counting my electricity usage. My bill is now $100 higher than before. For ELEVEN YEARS I was blissfully unaware that I had free electricity. I immediately called the new gas supplier and canceled their service but I'm sure that the Kraken is out and I'll have to pay for electricity from now on. Because I never paid for electricity, I don't even know much much this fuck-up is going to cost me in the long run. Fortunately I'm moving in a year so the damage will be limited, but still.

TL;DR: I exchanged a $15 Walmart gift card to pay extra $1,000+/year.
