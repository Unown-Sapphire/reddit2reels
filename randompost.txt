Am I the asshole For letting my niece choose where her family lives?
My brother died when my niece was 10. He was divorced from SIL at the time of his death. My brother's assets and my niece's cut of my parent's estate were placed in a trust for my niece. I was in charge of the trust. There was some back and forth with SIL over who controlled the trust, but I was ultimately the one who got control. The trust was basically able to pay off what was my brother's house and the interest from the estate pays for its upkeep. There isn't much left after that but at least my niece has a paid off house. In leu of my SIL going after the estate for child support I let her, and my niece move into the house rent free. 

My niece just turned 17 and is headed to her senior year of high school. My SIL has since remarried and has a new family with him one kid and one step kid. The new husband and family has moved into the house. The new husband apparently just got a job transfer and the whole family will have to move for the job. I talked to my niece about the move, and she hates the idea. She doesn't want to move with only one year left in HS. I agree with her on that issue.

My SIL wants me to sell the current house and use the funds to buy a new house in the new location. I told her that was automatically a no go. I wouldn't buy a house in a new location with my niece only likely living there full time for one more year. My niece plans to go to college and not likely in the area of the new house. This would be more a benefit for SIL than niece.

I gave my SIL three options. 

1. The family can continue to live in the current house and continue the deal as is. This means new hubby's job will fall through. The new location is closer to his family. 

2. We can sell the house; I will put the money into the trust. This will force my niece to move with her family. They may have to downsize because of me not giving money for a new house.

3. The family moves and then my niece stays behind she essentially does her senior year alone in the house. I'm not far from them and can check on her but can't be there daily. I'm out of her school district so she can't live with me and still go to the same school.

My Sil hates me right now over tearing her family apart. I really don't care about her hating me. 

If my niece was starting HS and not finishing it, I might act differently and not give her no as much weight in this decision. I might be willing to let SIL use the money to buy a new house. The issue is because she close to the end. I don't want to disrupt her schooling. If my niece said yes to the move, I might be willing to let SIL use the money as well. So Am I the asshole for letting my niece choose where her family lives?
