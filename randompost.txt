Today I fucked up by not getting my food off the cooking plate while answering a phone call from work.
So I'm on call for work this week and last evening I got an alarm about a technical problem at the lab (I'm a lab technician). The maintenance company couldn't access the server f to see what was the problem so I had to go to the lab to check it and fill them in on the problem.

The FU part is, I was making myself soup at this point. My pot was heating on the electric cooking plate when I answered the call and, instead of getting it off the plate, I just turned the heat wheel to the off position. 

Or so I thought. I actually turned the heat all the way up.
