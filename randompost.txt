WIBTA if I asked for my sister to pay me back 35 grand?
Ok so about two years ago my mother died. When she died she left a trust fund for me and my four siblings. We are each supposed to be receiving 20,000 per year. It is all put on one account then supposed to be split up and my grandma is supposed to handle it. Her favorite grandchild has always been my oldest sister for many reasons but I didn’t expect this to go this far. My sister was raised by my grandmother and didn’t live with us for most of our lives so she was the least close with my mom. Within the first year of the trust fund we find out she is getting 50% while me and my other siblings are splitting the other 50%. she also spent 35,000 extra on other things including paying for her apartment in upper east side Manhattan and going to stunt school in atlanta while still paying for the apartment in NYC. She also has gone on many shopping spree’s and out to dinner with the money from the trust that isn’t rightfully hers. It is her fault and my grandmas but am I wrong for expecting her to pay it back? I’m not sure how I should go about this and if I should ask for the money back.
