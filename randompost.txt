Today I fucked up wandered onto a US Army Military Base as foreigners looking for a pool
So this happened earlier last week, and for abit of context, my buddy and I are both Canadians and had graduated from university earlier this month. We decided for a celbratory road trip, we would drive from BC (where we're from), down to California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and eventually Louisiana before beelining it back to Canada for work. 

So by this point, we're a few days in and arrived in El Paso, Texas. We decided we'd walk down to Cuidad Juarez just to check things out after watching the movie Sicario, and the day before, we visited White Sands, New Mexico. 

After returning from Juarez, it was past noon already, and we felt like were being roasted alive in the Texas heat and figured we'd cool ourselves down at a local community pool. I search up some pretty good pools online, and set the GPS waypoint to the closest one. The directions told me it was located right after a right turn from the highway off-ramp, and as I make the turn I realize we had ventured onto a US Army military base (Fort Bliss, home to the 1st Armored Division). I tell my buddy we should just make a u-turn and get out of there before we went in too deep to the gates. He says let's just try anyways, and boy was that a terrible decision. 

As we pull up, I tell the military personell our mistake, and show him our only available form of ID (Canadian passports, etc). He says they'll just take a look at those and have us on our way very soon. That was the biggest understatement I've ever heard. They ended up closing the lane I was ine, and I knew we were in for a long ride. Shortly after, a pair of MP's show up (military police) and started questioning us and had us fill detailed forms. They basically mapped out and pieced together our entire trip plan, personal background, and where we were before then. When they heard we went to Juarez earlier in the day, they asked for screenshots of hotel reservations we made in El Paso and kept asking if we spoke more than 1 language (Spanish specifically). Before I knew it 4 additional army investigators in civillian attire showed up, and from there, they took our photos (mugshot style), photos of my car, conducted a search on my car, and even went to photograph every single page of my car's registration papers, before going through both my buddy and I's phones and laptop photos & messages. The entire process took over 2 hours before they cleared us and sent us on our way. At most, there were 12 Army personell around us at the gates (MP's, investigators, army people) dealing with the shitstorm we stirred.The MP's were really nice and we chatted with them quite abit, but honestly, one of the craziest experiences of my life. 

  
Too long didn't read: My buddy and I wandered onto a US Military base by accident looking for a pool as foreigners and were interrogated for 2 hours before allowing us to u-turn out of the base.
