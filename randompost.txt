TIFU by making an inappropriate comment to a coworker
I can’t stop kicking myself over this, so tell me if it’s really that bad. 

3 months ago, I started working from home for a really small, very close, all-women company. I met with a group of women for a work event on Thursday (3 days ago) and spent most of the time chatting amongst ourselves. 

While I was talking (excessively) because I was so excited to see other people I work with, the topic of sports came up and I mentioned that I played soccer seriously and never got rid of the really strong thick thighs, and the other women agreed. 

The (gorgeous) young woman closest to my age made a comment along the lines, “Me too - oh well!! gotta live with them.” 

I was trying so hard in my head to say something nice or funny, I accidentally combined too many choices and ended up spitting out, “well your husband doesn’t seem to mind!!”

Facepalm. 

We were already packing up and fizzling out the conversation so I couldn’t really tell how bad my comment really was. She stepped out with everyone so I didn’t even get to see her reaction - I just know that was such an awful thing to say. I don’t believe in that sort of behavior - much less behave that way myself. I am mortified with myself. Disgusted!! I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I’m hoping that since that is not regular for me, she can brush off a one-time occurrence bad comment and probably won’t spend that much time worrying about it or letting it effect our long term relationship, but on the other hand, I would be so sick if I knew I hurt her with my words. I don’t even know if I should reach out at this point. 

TL;DR:

Said to a coworker, “at least your husband doesn’t mind!” about her bodyAITA? For calling my fiancé a bad father?
I 28 year old female have been together with my fiancé 30 Male for 10 years. We have 3 kids. F9, F7 and M4. He is a great provider and I have had the options of working or staying home. For the past 5 years I have been a stay at home mom. I enjoy it! Ok so we had our oldest daughter (9) at 18 and 20. She’s a loving, caring and very energetic baby girl. She loves cuddling and talking about her day and her friends and school she’s a great student as well. My fiancé is very rough with her in the sense of being strict and shutting her emotions down. Tonight my daughter started crying to me and telling me how she hates the fact that her dad is always angry at all of us and how he never wants to hear her out that’s it’s so overwhelming for her. I told her I understood and called her dad over so she could express her feelings to him. I teach all of my kids that it is definitely ok to express your emotions especially when something you don’t like is being done to you. So he went at first she was scared until she finally told him and he kicked me out of her room and I thought it was to speak to her more about it instead I overhear him say “you have to understand that I didn’t have the love your mom had my mom was an evil women and didn’t give me the love I needed. I don’t want to talk about this now especially if you are crying. I love you go to sleep” as he walked out I couldn’t bear to even look at him. I walked into my daughters room her eyes bawling out she couldn’t even breathe without even thinking I lay next to her and hug her tightly she says “I wasn’t even finished talking and he just walked away he didn’t even give me a hug I dont understand” I started crying with her my heart broke in a million pieces. We talked some more and I helped her relax and assured her she could always count on me. As I walked to our room I sit down and tell him everything calmly. He doesn’t say a single word, which usually he never says any single thing. He just gets up and lays down on the floor exhaling a “I need some space” I get extremely mad and say to him “if you are being a bad dad just own up to it. You’re a bad dad just own it and fix it” again silence from him. 
Now I am in bed as he sleeps on the floor and I am realizing that only because we have a 2 parent home doesn’t mean we have a 2 parent home if one parent isn’t present. Yes I have offered him to go to therapy, he refuses. I also understand this is triggering for me as someone who was raised by a single mother, all I ever wanted was my kids to have a decent dad. I’m not saying he is the worst dad of all time but I am saying he never hears anyone out. He shut us all down and says we need to “relax”. He is always right and we are always wrong in his eyes. Sometimes I feel like packing us my kids and leaving. AITA? Am I overreacting?
