Am I the asshole for telling my girlfriends nephew he wasn't going to the NBA?
My GFs nephew who is a freshman in highschool joined my son and I at the park. I watched him almost get beat at b-ball by a 5th grader wearing one shoe. The only reason he did win was because he cheated on game point multiple times. Afterwards he started bragging about how he was going to the NBA and I told him, that wasn't going to happen. He asked why I was hating and I explained that at his age, size, passion for the game and skill level it just wasn't going to happen. the kid can't even dribble the ball without double dribbling, has never played on a team, doesn't even own a basketball and is a freshman in highschool. I told him he could be great at something and become rich and famous but just not playing in the NBA. He seemed to appreciate the discussion as he is very immature for his age, doesn't have a male influence around and his family treats him like a small child.

The next day his mother called me up and was very angry. I told her we were just 2 dude shooting shit at the park and if that was an issue to not send him to my house anymore.
