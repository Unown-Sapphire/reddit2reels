Today I fucked up by not realizing I was autistic 
So this happened a few weeks ago actually but… I had come from a regular primary care drs appointment. Because of technology and whatnot my doctors office has an app that shows diagnoses and medications etc. I noticed under the diagnoses section that I had Autism. I thought “oh someone at the doctors office made a mistake” because while I had been tested for autism I was not diagnosed with it.

So I brought this up to my mom, who basically said wtf, yes you are. She then relayed to me the whole saga of me getting diagnosed.

My memory of it is that I got tested and the doctor said something along the lines of “well we can’t call it Asperger’s” which I took to mean that I fit some of the criteria but not enough to have a diagnosis. It was then explained to me that she meant she couldn’t call is Asperger’s because that is no longer the name since autism is on a spectrum.
I’ve relayed this story to several family members and their general response is to say, “yeaahhh…?” So apparently I was the only one who did not know in the last 10 years that I was autistic.


Too long didn't read: just learned I am autistic after being diagnosed 10 years ago because I misunderstood the doctor 

Edit: changed related to relayed. Tried to make paragraphs more clear.

Also I feel the need to stick up for my parents, they didn’t hide the diagnosis from me, they got me the help I needed, I just misunderstand what the help was for since I also have anxiety and depression. I assumed that the occupational therapy I went to was for those diagnoses. 

I appreciate everyone sharing their story but my diagnosis was not hidden I just didn’t understand it correctly and everyone assumed I did. It is probably also mostly my fault because I have little memory of the appointment meaning I probably wasn’t paying attention when it WAS being explained.
