Today I fucked up by Spilling Scalding Hot Coffee on My Privates During a Road Trip
This happened just a few hours ago and I'm still trying to recover from the embarrassment and pain. So, my Parents and I decided to take a road trip to my Grandmothers in Niagara Falls.  So, We're cruising down the highway, And I'm in the backseat enjoying my Nice Hot Mcdonalds BLACK Coffee.

Now, let me set the scene,  we're all Talking and joking around, having a great time. I reach down to grab my phone from the floor of the car, and in the process, my elbow somehow knocks my Cup right into my lap. The lid pops off, and scalding hot coffee spills all over my crotch.

Instantly, I go from laughing to screaming bloody murder. My Parents slam on the brakes, thinking we've hit something or that I'm having a medical emergency. I'm flailing around, trying to undo my seatbelt and trying not to make a bigger mess in the car.

Finally, they pull over, and I stumble out of the car, half in pain and half in embarrassment. I manage to peel off my jeans and boxers right there on the side of the road, while my Parents are alternating between concerned and trying not to laugh. Meanwhile, I'm desperately trying to cool down the burns with water from our cooler, feeling like the world's biggest idiot.

After what feels like an eternity of roadside humiliation, I manage to clean myself up as best as I can and get back into the car. Needless to say, the rest of the road trip was a lot quieter as I sat there nursing my wounded pride and even more wounded privates.

Lesson learned: always make sure your lid is securely fastened, especially when you're on a bumpy road trip.

Too long didn't read: Tried to enjoy coffee on a road trip, ended up with burns on my nether regions and a story I'll never live down with my Parents. I'm sticking to iced from now on
