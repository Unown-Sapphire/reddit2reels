TIFU by possibly giving a man lead poisoningTIFU, literally today, still dealing with the feels. Wife asked for a divorce about 3 months back, and the plan's to divorce after house is sold. Really rough for me emotionally, still is.  She started posting expectations for her next man on facebook, insta, etc. and of course it felt like jabs at me. Couldn't take the emotional hurt so blocked her on everything but her phone number/email for divorce/house sale.   


never knew her reddit account. We typically frequented different sub reddits so never really was an issue. Well today while doom scrolling, was reading a post and it was uncannily familiar. Our ages/sexes, same time  period, same events but her perspective. Username checked out with her usual stuff, straight up villianizing me. Asking why she still cares.   


Ripped all the scabs off the wounds and just, fuckin collapsed. I know she still cares for me, and is trying to hate me to cope with the break up(she's admitted several times). its why i blocked all her shit in the first place.   


tldr; when going through divorce shit, make sure to do due diligence when blocking.
