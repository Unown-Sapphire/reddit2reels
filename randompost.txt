Today I fucked up by not asking how my wife was
This happened a few hours ago. 

My SIL is 18 weeks pregnant, and has two other kids. This morning, she went to the ER, and found out the baby had died. She didn't call us directly, but she called her parents, who live about 4 hours away, and in Canada. Her parents called my wife, who immediately jumped in the car and rushed to the ER. 

I went into a mechanical "make sure everything is taken care of" mode. I WFH, so I scooped up our kids, went and grabbed car seats and met my wife at the ER to pick up my SIL kids, so my wife could focus on her sister. I called her parents to make sure they had the necessary arrangements to come down. I swapped vehicles around to make sure we could take care of all the kids together, got them lunch etc. I was texting though the whole time to see how SIL was doing, if her husband had showed up etc. 

When my wife got back, we sat down and she told the story of what happened, and I was showing (genuine) concern for her sister etc. once things seemed calmed down, I asked my wife if she was ok if I went back to wrap up some work I abruptly walked away from. 

She looked at me and told me how cold and callused I was, and uncaring I was. I was blown away. Then she started bawling, and I realized... I never stopped to check on my wife. And she wasn't handling it well. 

I gave her a big hug and held her for a while, and sat down and we talked for about an hour. 

Lesson: even when you're trying to help, make sure you don't forget to pay attention to those who are also trying to help, who may need help themselves. 

Tl;Dr: became too mechanical in making sure everything was taken care of, to free my wife up to care for her sister. Forgot to pay attention to how my wife was.

edit: the comments are pretty much split into two pretty distinct camps.  "Your wife's an abusive selfish bitch" and "that's a really hard situation where emotions are high and everyone is figuring it out as you go.".  I appriciate you all, but, my wife is a wonderful woman, and she wasn't being selfish in the least bit. Quite the opposite, she dropped everything to jump into the deep end with her sister, and didn't allow herself to face her own feelings until later.  Her choice of words weren't the best, as her emotions broke through the dam, but she's allowed to let them spill.  If you take everything defensively, especially from people who are in pain (directly or sympathetically), you'll be angry at everyone all the time.  In a lot of ways, she and I have had a really positive day in terms of supporting each other and working together to support the rest of the family.  We make a great team, but we're still both only human.  Also, married 17 years, so we've weathered alot together. One little comment isn't going to define the day, much less our relationship. 

Also, damn! I feel like I'm getting some medal of honor for doing what should be kind of baseline "someone is in need, go help" stuff.  But I appriciate it, and a little praise always feels good!
