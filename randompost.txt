Today I fucked up By not knowing the boy who harassed me was autistic

	Ok so, I am fourteen years old and obviously a girl. Today whilst I was in my neighborhood park I saw a group of highschool boys playing football (not unusual). So, whilst I was walking one of them that I kinda know yelled “Hey [name]! You’re fourteen right?” so I was obviously like “Yeah!” because I am in fact fourteen. 

So he tells me that his friend said that i’m sexy, and that his friend wants my number. I just kinda laughed it off because its not that serious, just a little creepy. So I walked around again since I was waiting for my friend to arrive and the same guy called me over to the group of boys, so I walked over. The guy asks me to give his friend my number, and I obviously said “No thank you”. 

So whilst I was like turned around walking back to the concrete part of the park one of the boys yells to me that the boy who liked me said he wanted to SA me, I just ignored it because again its not that big of a deal.

So they go back to their friend’s house I assume and I get a call from a random number on my phone, it wasn’t labeled as a scam so I picked it up. It was basically just the guy asking me to replace his girlfriend so I decided to ask him if he was “Too ‘restarted’ to know I can block your number?”.

So apparently he was actually an autist, which I didn’t know! I just thought he was regular stupid  and not actually impaired. I don’t feel too bad though.. just a little exploited because apparently he has a plan to actually assault me.

Too long didn't read I think I accidentally hatecrimed a boy
