11
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,260
I posted this

12
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,320
same situation in

13
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,480
legal advice, too.

14
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,580
It is based

15
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,120
in England.

16
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,260
In the public

17
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,300
work folder, as

18
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,760
in the homepage

19
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,380
which then has

20
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,160
subfolders with the

21
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,640
work packages

22
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,520
in, I found

23
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,020
an offer letter

24
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,840
PDF for promotion

25
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,280
of a girl

26
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,740
in my teen,

27
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,720
it contains salary

28
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,300
information

29
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,860
and the job

30
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,180
title.

31
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,280
The promotion was

32
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,980
public and written

33
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,580
on the whiteboard

34
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,040
in the office.

35
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,060
The salary is

36
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,000
publicly known and

37
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,860
advertised salary.

38
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,760
As there was

39
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,300
only one other

40
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,820
so far in

41
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,360
the office, I

42
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,420
initiated moving it,

43
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:30,960
somewhere

44
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,740
buried but still

45
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,200
in the public

46
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,960
folder before I

47
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,600
could report it.

48
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,580
I told my

49
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,220
colleague what I'd

50
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,760
found and was

51
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,540
doing, and he

52
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:36,940
told me to

53
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,560
stop and not

54
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:37,980
touch it.

55
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,760
So I stopped

56
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,420
and didn't touch

57
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,560
it.

58
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,060
There was now

59
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,360
two copies, one

60
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:41,640
in the main

61
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,440
folder and one

62
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,820
in the buried

63
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,240
folder.

64
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,780
I reported it

65
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,160
to the girl

66
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,480
that it was

67
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,840
in the main

68
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,240
folder, and completely

69
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,920
glossed over,

70
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,460
there was a

71
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,080
second copy.

72
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,440
And just changed

73
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:50,980
the name of

74
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,920
the duplicate file.

75
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,180
Five minutes later

76
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,360
I realized that's

77
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,400
stupid, and I

78
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,940
went back and

79
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,600
deleted it and

80
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,820
deleted

81
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,400
it again from

82
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,100
my recycle bin.

83
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,040
To the team

84
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,660
they have records

85
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,360
of me copying

86
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,380
it, changing the

87
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,320
name, then deleting

88
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,740
it over

89
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,220
the course of

90
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,800
four or five

91
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,140
hours.

92
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,140
They are telling

93
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,740
me I've acted

94
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,800
untoward and without

95
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,680
truth or integrity,

96
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,540
and it has

97
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,860
breached

98
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,180
trust.

99
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,240
I've tried to

100
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,820
explain my thought

101
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,680
process but everybody

102
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,220
is in self

103
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,500
-defense mode, especially

104
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,240
the management chain

105
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,600
that put the

106
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,180
document there in

107
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,660
the first place

108
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,120
to be handled

109
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,480
by me

110
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,080
as a contractor

111
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,620
in such a

112
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:17,820
way.

113
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,800
Deal, dear.

114
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,060
Found a personal

115
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,820
promotion that was

116
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,460
salary in the

117
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,440
company wide homepage.

118
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,640
I took steps

119
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,300
to move it,

120
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,480
but abandoned that

121
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,820
and inadvertently created

122
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,440
two copies.

123
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,720
I later realized

124
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,500
I'd fucked up

125
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,120
and went into

126
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,780
a self-protection

127
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,140
cycle, changed the

128
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,260
name

129
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,820
of the document,

130
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,740
and then deleted

131
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,060
it.
