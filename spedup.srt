1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
Today I fucked

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,080
up by not

3
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,800
realizing I was

4
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,200
autistic.

5
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,400
So this happened

6
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,860
a few weeks

7
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,660
ago actually, but

8
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,660
I had come

9
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,240
from a regular

10
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,900
primary care

11
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,660
DR appointment.

12
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,060
Because of technology

13
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,540
and what not

14
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,300
my doctor's office

15
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,800
has an app

16
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,720
that shows diagnoses

17
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,700
and medications, etc.

18
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,600
I noticed under

19
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,520
the diagnoses section

20
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,960
that I had

21
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,220
autism.

22
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,640
I thought, oh

23
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,160
someone at the

24
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,940
doctor's office made

25
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,140
a mistake, because

26
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,600
while I had

27
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,000
been tested

28
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
for autism, I

29
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,900
was not diagnosed

30
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,400
with it.

31
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,360
So I brought

32
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,800
this up to

33
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,880
my mom, who

34
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,100
basically said WTF.

35
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,480
Yes you are.

36
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,780
She then relayed

37
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,080
to me the

38
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,060
whole saga of

39
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,920
me getting diagnosed.

40
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,260
My memory of

41
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,540
it is that

42
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,100
I got tested,

43
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,980
and the doctor

44
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,760
said something along

45
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,400
the lines of,

46
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,360
well we can't

47
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,740
call it as

48
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,120
birders.

49
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,020
Which I took

50
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,440
to mean that

51
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,940
I fit some

52
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,600
of the criteria,

53
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,480
but not enough

54
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:41,800
to have a

55
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,220
diagnosis.

56
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,320
It was then

57
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,980
explained to me

58
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,620
that she meant

59
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,240
she couldn't call

60
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,860
as as birders,

61
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,460
because that is

62
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:46,920
no longer the

63
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,660
name since autism

64
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,120
is on the

65
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,340
spectrum.

66
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,900
I've relayed this

67
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,700
story to several

68
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,260
family members, and

69
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,180
their general responses

70
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,420
to say, yeah?

71
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,880
So apparently I

72
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,300
was the only

73
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,640
one who did

74
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,080
not know in

75
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,560
the last 10

76
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,040
years that I

77
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,500
was autistic.

78
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,740
Too long didn't

79
00:00:59,740 --> 00:00:59,940
read.

80
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,520
Just learned I

81
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,440
am autistic after

82
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,400
being diagnosed 10

83
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
years ago, because

84
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,400
I misunderstood the

85
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,680
doctor.

86
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,360
Aided.

87
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,160
Changed related to

88
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,640
relayed.

89
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,560
Tried to make

90
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,520
paragraphs more clear.

91
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,680
Also I feel

92
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,120
the need to

93
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,520
stick up for

94
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,960
my parents.

95
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,800
They didn't hide

96
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,580
the diagnosis from

97
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,740
me.

98
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,440
They got me

99
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,800
the help I

100
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,060
needed.

101
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,120
I just misunderstand

102
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,780
what the help

103
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,360
was for since

104
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,020
I also have

105
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,840
anxiety and depression.

106
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,060
I assumed that

107
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,940
the occupational therapy

108
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,540
I went to

109
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,320
was for those

110
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,960
diagnoses.

111
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,380
I appreciate everyone

112
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,160
sharing their story,

113
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,560
but my diagnosis

114
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,340
was not hidden.

115
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,480
I just didn't

116
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,340
understand it correctly,

117
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,480
and everyone assumed

118
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,860
I did.

119
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,860
It is probably

120
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,740
also mostly my

121
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,760
fault, because I

122
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,360
have little memory

123
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,880
of the appointment

124
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,680
meaning I probably

125
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,580
wasn't paying attention,

126
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,320
where it was

127
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,920
being explained.
