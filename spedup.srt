6
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,160
This is super

7
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,580
embarrassing.

8
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,960
And I seriously

9
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,200
hope, none of

10
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,600
you make the

11
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,200
mistake I made

12
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,660
last night.

13
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,360
I've loved psychedelics

14
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,720
for years.

15
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,960
I've had my

16
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,520
ups and downs

17
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,460
during experiences.

18
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,700
But I've always

19
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,360
managed to keep

20
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,060
my mental state

21
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,180
together enough to

22
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,180
differentiate between

23
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,480
real issues and

24
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,180
perceived ones.

25
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,340
Last night I

26
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,020
attended a show.

27
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,160
Nothing I'd planned

28
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,820
in advance but

29
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,260
a group I'd

30
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,180
always enjoyed nonetheless.

31
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,320
I got some

32
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,880
boomers off a

33
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,480
friend last minute

34
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,840
and made a

35
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,300
slice on the

36
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,840
ride up there.

37
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,860
Within about a

38
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,340
half an hour

39
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,900
I started having

40
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,920
very strange physical

41
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,680
symptoms, tingling extremities,

42
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,400
chest pain.

43
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,640
Not our typical

44
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,460
mushroom sensations.

45
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,720
I sat myself

46
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,340
down and tried

47
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,020
to collect myself

48
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,580
after all.

49
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,660
I'd taken these

50
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,280
booms before.

51
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
Thinking we're going

52
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,620
to die on

53
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,120
high dose psychedelics

54
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,080
isn't a common

55
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,400
thing.

56
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,600
But it isn't

57
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,120
all that uncommon

58
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,620
either.

59
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,600
I just didn't

60
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,040
think this would

61
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,600
ever happen to

62
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:51,780
me.

63
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,840
If I'm dose

64
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,640
that heavy usually

65
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,260
texting is out

66
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,680
of the question.

67
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,780
I have very

68
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,600
little recollection of

69
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,500
this occurring, but

70
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,340
I texted everyone.

71
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,500
Mother, sister, best

72
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,660
friends, ex-best

73
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,200
friends who I

74
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,620
wanted to make

75
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,000
up with.

76
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:03,980
That I was

77
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,560
going to die.

78
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,220
100% tonight.

79
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,480
I texted ex

80
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,260
-girlfriends who I

81
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,000
never really even

82
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,780
think about anymore

83
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,760
wonderfully abstract

84
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
poetry saying goodnight

85
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,580
and good bye.

86
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,600
Essentially.

87
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,540
I'm not at

88
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,080
all sure why

89
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,360
I had the

90
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,060
symptoms I had.

91
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,460
But apparently they

92
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,260
didn't manifest any

93
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,540
further.

94
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,560
I didn't come

95
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,060
back to myself

96
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,680
enough to realize

97
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,300
what I'd done

98
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,840
until the car

99
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,280
ride back.

100
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,940
Now, self-pity,

101
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,500
and embarrassment, beyond

102
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,280
anything I've known.

103
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,280
The only good

104
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,680
I see from

105
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:27,960
it is that

106
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,520
I actually ended

107
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,060
up saying some

108
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,680
things to people.

109
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,660
That I only

110
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,080
think I would

111
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,520
have said how

112
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,240
I honestly thought

113
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,640
it was my

114
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,400
last sentence to

115
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,560
them.

116
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,320
Friends.

117
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,180
Bye.

118
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Etchin.

119
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:36,960
And I guess

120
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,620
there's something to

121
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,140
be said about

122
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,320
that.

123
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,620
Too long didn't

124
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,840
read.

125
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,920
I told my

126
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,660
family and friends

127
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,140
that I was

128
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,720
going to die

129
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
while completely faced.

130
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sure I'll

131
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,720
be confronting this

132
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,320
for some time.
