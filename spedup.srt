1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Today I fucked

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,260
up by not

3
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:01,920
getting my food

4
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,520
off the cooking

5
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,360
plate while answering

6
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,960
a phone call

7
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,240
from.

8
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,080
Work. So I'm

9
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,620
on call for

10
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,240
work this week

11
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,000
and last evening

12
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,520
I got an

13
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,160
alarm about a

14
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,180
technical problem at

15
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,300
the.

16
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,940
Lab. I'm a

17
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,260
lab technician. The

18
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,520
maintenance company couldn't

19
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,340
access the server

20
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,940
F to see

21
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,380
what was the

22
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,240
problems I had

23
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,720
to go to.

24
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,000
The lab to

25
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,540
check it and

26
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,080
fill them in

27
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,680
on the problem.

28
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,160
The food part

29
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
is, I was

30
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,180
making myself soup

31
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,800
at this point.

32
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,900
My pot was

33
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,400
heating on the

34
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
electric cooking plate

35
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,040
when I answered

36
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,720
the call end.

37
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,080
Instead of getting

38
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,560
it off the

39
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
plate, I just

40
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,200
turned the heat

41
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,720
wheel to the

42
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,300
off position.

43
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,320
Or so I

44
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,400
thought, I actually

45
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,080
turned the heat

46
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,540
all the way

47
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,520
up. I then

48
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,060
left to the

49
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,320
lab, leaving my

50
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,480
pot unattended because

51
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,260
my GF is

52
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,860
at her mother's

53
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,340
for the week.

54
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,260
The technical problem

55
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,160
was a solenoid

56
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,080
valve not answering

57
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,700
on a nitrogen

58
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,400
liquid tank.

59
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm a lab

60
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,740
technician in biology

61
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,880
asterisk so I

62
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,320
didn't get it

63
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,640
either.

64
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,060
It took an

65
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,560
hour and a

66
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,280
half to determine

67
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,860
what it was

68
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,400
and how to

69
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,940
fix it with

70
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,640
the maintenance guy

71
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:56,920
on.

72
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,640
The phone had

73
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,320
to resort to

74
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,860
keep the parts

75
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,560
in place with

76
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,200
the rubber band.

77
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,100
Not kidding. And

78
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,580
then I had

79
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:03,980
to call a

80
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,000
biologist to see

81
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,360
if it could

82
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,240
wait until Monday

83
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,860
for a proper

84
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,220
repair.

85
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,700
I went back

86
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,840
home, opened the

87
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,340
door and my

88
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,120
poor dog ran

89
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,520
out of the

90
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,900
apartment.

91
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,400
Completely panicked. That's

92
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,880
when I noticed

93
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,100
the smell. I

94
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,600
ran to the

95
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,220
kitchen and I

96
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,880
saw a smoking

97
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,500
cooking pot.

98
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,080
Soup stains all

99
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,700
over the wall

100
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,320
and the counter.

101
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,420
And a strong

102
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,160
burning smell.

103
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,700
I quickly realized

104
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,200
I could have

105
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,980
started a fire.

106
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,560
Destroyed the apartment

107
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,540
and most importantly

108
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,380
killed my dog.

109
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,380
Even if the

110
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,200
fire alarm had

111
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,060
alerted my neighbors.

112
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,680
I immediately turned

113
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,060
everything off. Put

114
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,720
the cooking pot

115
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,280
in the sink

116
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,940
with water to

117
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,320
cool it.

118
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,580
And opened the

119
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,980
windows. The vegetables

120
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,820
had burned and

121
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,440
formed a thick

122
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
black crust in

123
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,800
the bottom of

124
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,100
the pot.

125
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,560
And my plastic

126
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,420
ladle and melted

127
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,240
and fused with

128
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,380
it.

129
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,280
I tried to

130
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,700
get it off

131
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,340
today but I

132
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,980
gave up after

133
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,520
an hour of

134
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,180
nothing budging.

135
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,740
My dog was

136
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,460
shaking and she

137
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,060
wouldn't go back

138
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,700
in the apartment.

139
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,120
The poor thing

140
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,620
was terrified. By

141
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,160
the time the

142
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,920
smell was gone,

143
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,100
my dog was

144
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,960
calmed and everything

145
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,180
backed almost normal.

146
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,220
It was past

147
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,980
midnight and I

148
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,740
still hadn't eaten.

149
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,880
I ended up

150
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,680
ordering a pizza.

151
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,680
And of course

152
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
it costed extra

153
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
for delivery after

154
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,940
midnight.

155
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,120
I spent my

156
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,000
morning cleaning up

157
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
my mess. Trying

158
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
to salvage the

159
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,800
pot then giving

160
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,080
up.

161
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,240
And finding new

162
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,940
spot where the

163
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,780
soup stains got.

164
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,040
My dog still

165
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
won't enter the

166
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,340
kitchen and the

167
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,960
smell is still

168
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,240
there.

169
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,660
Even if it's

170
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,940
fainter, my GF

171
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,380
is going to

172
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,920
be pissed.

173
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,120
Too long didn't

174
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,200
read. Answered a

175
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,900
call from work

176
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,420
while I was

177
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,980
making soup.

178
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Left to work

179
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,660
with the soup

180
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,280
still on the

181
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,500
plate.

182
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,620
Went home two

183
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,460
hours later to

184
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,080
a burnt soup.

185
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,300
A ruined pot.

186
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,720
A disgusting kitchen

187
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,620
and a traumatized

188
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,940
dog.

189
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,000
All because I

190
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,680
didn't check if

191
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,180
the plate was

192
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,900
actually off.

193
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,900
Edit. Orthography and

194
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,220
grammar.

195
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,420
Also added a

196
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,820
paragraph.
