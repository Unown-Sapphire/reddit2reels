5
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,700
This happened a

6
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,280
few hours ago.

7
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,440
My sill is

8
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,340
18 weeks pregnant,

9
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,440
and has two

10
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,880
other kids.

11
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,700
This morning, she

12
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,080
went to the

13
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,200
ER, and found

14
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,020
out the baby

15
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,440
had died.

16
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,420
She didn't call

17
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,360
us directly, but

18
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,700
she called a

19
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,720
parents, who live

20
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,320
about four hours

21
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,600
away,

22
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,900
and in Canada.

23
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,960
Her parents called

24
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,040
my wife, who

25
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,860
immediately jumped in

26
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,600
the car, and

27
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,080
rushed to the

28
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,360
ER.

29
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,440
I went into

30
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,240
a mechanical make

31
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,440
sure everything's taken

32
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,200
care of mode.

33
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,280
I double-f

34
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,940
-pa, so I

35
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,420
scooped up our

36
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,300
kids, went in

37
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,120
grabbed car seats,

38
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,620
and met my

39
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:30,980
wife at

40
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,440
the ER to

41
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,840
pick up my

42
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,400
sill kids.

43
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,620
So my wife

44
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,400
could focus on

45
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,820
her sister.

46
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,940
I called her

47
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,560
parents to make

48
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,000
sure they had

49
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,860
the necessary arrangements

50
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,480
to come down.

51
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,760
I swapped vehicles

52
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,420
around to make

53
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,860
sure we could

54
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,320
take care of

55
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,700
all the kids

56
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,100
together,

57
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,120
got them lunch,

58
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,660
etc.

59
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,920
I was texting

60
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,360
though the whole

61
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,940
time to see

62
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,540
how sill was

63
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,520
doing, if her

64
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,060
husband had showed

65
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,560
up, etc.

66
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,680
When my wife

67
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,760
got back, we

68
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,800
sat down, and

69
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,220
she told the

70
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,680
story of what

71
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,640
happened, and I

72
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:53,760
was

73
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,480
showing, genuine, concerned

74
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,100
for her sister,

75
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,460
etc.

76
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,640
Once things seemed

77
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,220
calm down.

78
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,200
I asked my

79
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,720
wife if she

80
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,320
was okay if

81
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,640
I went back

82
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,040
to wrap up

83
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,580
some work I

84
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,180
abruptly walked

85
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,580
away from.

86
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,520
She looked at

87
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,900
me and told

88
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,520
me how cold

89
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,240
and calloused I

90
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,500
was.

91
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,900
And I'm caring

92
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,400
I was.

93
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,420
I was blown

94
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,760
away.

95
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,040
Then she started

96
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,720
bawling and I

97
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,960
realized, I never

98
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,520
stopped to check

99
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,160
on my wife.

100
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,360
And she wasn't

101
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,980
handling it well.

102
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,140
I gave her

103
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,660
a big hug

104
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,240
and held her

105
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,760
for a while,

106
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,900
and sat down

107
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,340
and we talked

108
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,960
for about an

109
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,220
hour.

110
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,220
Lesson.

111
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Even when you're

112
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,400
trying to help,

113
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,580
make sure you

114
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,260
don't forget to

115
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,100
pay attention to

116
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,300
those

117
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,880
who are also

118
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,560
trying to help,

119
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,560
who may need

120
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,180
help themselves.

121
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,560
T.L. doctor.

122
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,880
Became too mechanical

123
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,400
and making sure

124
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,080
everything was taken

125
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
care of, to

126
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,600
free my wife

127
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,840
up to

128
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,220
care for her

129
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,500
sister.

130
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,580
Forgot to pay

131
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,240
attention to how

132
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,860
my wife was.

133
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,760
It did.

134
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,980
The comments are

135
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,660
pretty much split

136
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,420
into two pretty

137
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,040
distinct camps.

138
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,320
Your wife's an

139
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,460
abusive selfish bitch.

140
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,740
And that's a

141
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,860
really hard situation

142
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,820
where emotions are

143
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,240
high, and everyone

144
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,660
is figuring

145
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,400
it out as

146
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,760
you go.

147
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,180
I appreciate you

148
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,480
all.

149
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,900
But my wife

150
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,400
is a wonderful

151
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
woman, and she

152
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,200
wasn't being selfish

153
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,740
in a least

154
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:56,980
bit.

155
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,060
Quite the opposite.

156
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,240
She dropped everything

157
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,760
to jump into

158
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,180
the deep end

159
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,700
with her sister,

160
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,700
and didn't allow

161
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,940
herself

162
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,440
to face her

163
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,080
own feelings until

164
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,340
later.

165
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,520
Her choice of

166
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,140
words weren't the

167
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,140
best, as her

168
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,160
emotions broke through

169
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,480
the dam.

170
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,740
But she's allowed

171
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,200
to let them

172
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,420
spill.

173
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,340
If you take

174
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,940
everything defensively, especially

175
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,540
from people who

176
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,000
are in pain,

177
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
directly or sympathetically,

178
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,660
you'll be angry

179
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,280
at everyone all

180
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,660
the time.

181
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,520
In a lot

182
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,740
of ways, she

183
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,340
and I have

184
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,800
had a really

185
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
positive day, in

186
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
terms of supporting

187
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,420
each

188
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,500
other, and working

189
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,400
together to support

190
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,920
the rest of

191
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,360
the family.

192
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,320
We make a

193
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,380
great team, but

194
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,220
we're still both

195
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,780
only human.

196
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Also, married 17

197
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,480
years.

198
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,800
So we've weathered

199
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,460
a lot together.

200
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,760
One little comment

201
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,280
isn't going to

202
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,900
define the day,

203
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,720
much less our

204
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,120
relationship.

205
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,980
Also, damn.

206
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,060
I feel like

207
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm getting some

208
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,060
metal of honor

209
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,620
for doing what

210
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,100
should be kind

211
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,500
of baseline

212
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,140
someone is in

213
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,440
need.

214
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,300
Go help stuff.

215
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,500
But I appreciate

216
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:45,780
it.

217
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,040
And a little

218
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,860
praise always feels

219
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,180
good.
