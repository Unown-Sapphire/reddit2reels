1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Today I fucked

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,360
up by testing

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:01,780
to see if

4
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,320
anyone in my

5
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,260
office actually wanted

6
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:03,800
to talk to

7
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:03,920
me.

8
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,100
It all started

9
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,540
at the end

10
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:05,920
of April.

11
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,780
I have been

12
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,180
at my job

13
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,640
for a few

14
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,720
years, and Lighten

15
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,220
was well liked

16
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:09,760
by all of

17
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,280
my co-workers,

18
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,020
or so I

19
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,220
thought.

20
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,260
One day a

21
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,720
co-worker.

22
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,280
Mickey commented about

23
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,820
wanting to go

24
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,260
to a baseball

25
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,340
game, and I

26
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,780
jumped at the

27
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,200
opportunity.

28
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,580
I love baseball,

29
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,720
and really enjoyed

30
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,480
spending time with

31
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,680
Mickey.

32
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,200
Considering her close

33
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,900
work friend after

34
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,640
sharing my struggles

35
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,980
with anxiety, and

36
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,440
hearing of

37
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,200
her struggles with

38
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,880
goings on in

39
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,240
her life.

40
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,220
This began a

41
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,960
string of fucked

42
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,420
ups that leads

43
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,080
me to today.

44
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,080
I thought that

45
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,700
perhaps she didn't

46
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,200
mean to invite

47
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,660
me to join

48
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,100
her when I

49
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,760
asked when she

50
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,940
was going, and

51
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,600
she stumbled over

52
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,020
her words.

53
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,340
Oh, I hadn't

54
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,880
thought about it

55
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,220
that much.

56
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,840
Okay, well, let

57
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,280
me know when

58
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,680
you decide.

59
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,940
I'd love to

60
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,420
go with you.

61
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,360
Then in there

62
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,000
she looked up

63
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,640
game dates and

64
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,980
promos, and she

65
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,600
decided on a

66
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,120
weekend game

67
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,820
with an alcohol

68
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,320
promo.

69
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,460
Sweetie should be

70
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,200
a great time.

71
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,420
I asked if

72
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,100
anyone else was

73
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
going, and she

74
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,840
invited her cousins

75
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,820
to come, the

76
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,240
more the

77
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,540
better.

78
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,920
Everything was great

79
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,380
at the game.

80
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,300
We had a

81
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,020
good time until

82
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,820
she got plastered

83
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,280
and couldn't get

84
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,780
to the toilet

85
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,440
without assistance.

86
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,520
I won't go

87
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,940
into it in

88
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,000
detail, but Mickey

89
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,580
was also getting

90
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,420
very snugly with

91
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,120
me, as the

92
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,660
drinking progressed.

93
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,840
I don't have

94
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,220
a lot of

95
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,020
experience with women

96
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,500
to be honest.

97
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,660
A high school

98
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,340
romance and a

99
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,140
few college flings

100
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,560
are all I

101
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,920
have to be

102
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,260
the judge.

103
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,220
To me it

104
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,760
seemed that Mickey

105
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,420
was coming onto

106
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,640
me.

107
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,640
Strongly.

108
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,900
Cuddling by me

109
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,200
drinks.

110
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,360
Asking me to

111
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,780
walk with her

112
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,200
when she needed

113
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,700
to buy food

114
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,220
and holding my

115
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,780
arm tightly.

116
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,720
While at the

117
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
time I appreciated

118
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,740
the affection, I

119
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,220
was also quite

120
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,220
happy.

121
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,800
Quite concerned about

122
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,500
the ramifications.

123
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,680
Mickey was my

124
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,620
friend, and we

125
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,300
have had discussions

126
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,020
which made it

127
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,560
clear to me

128
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,260
we would not

129
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,920
be compatible

130
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,740
in that type

131
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,360
of relationship.

132
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,400
After we both

133
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
sobered up I

134
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,580
thought to ask

135
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,640
her, hey, was

136
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,260
all that snuggling

137
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,860
just you being

138
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,600
drunk and friendly?

139
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,820
Or where was

140
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,420
it something more?

141
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Mickey responded quickly

142
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,440
to the text

143
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,840
that it was

144
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,440
just her being

145
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,660
drunk, and she

146
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,140
was sorry.

147
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,060
If she gave

148
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,500
me the wrong

149
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,780
impression, or made

150
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,480
me uncomfortable.

151
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,660
CREAT!

152
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,520
I thought.

153
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,580
I never wanted

154
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:51,960
it to be

155
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,900
more, but if

156
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,280
it was there

157
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,740
needed to be

158
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,840
serious discussions about

159
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,000
it.

160
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,000
As she sits

161
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,780
directly next to

162
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,160
me at work,

163
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,140
and ran a

164
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,000
small office setting.

165
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,860
I thought I

166
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,360
was well that

167
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,820
ended well.

168
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,920
But after a

169
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,020
few days, I

170
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,520
noticed that Mickey

171
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,280
wasn't really talking

172
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,780
to me much

173
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,020
anymore.

174
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,080
I worried that

175
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,900
maybe asking her

176
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,560
about her behavior

177
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,040
had made her

178
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,940
uncomfortable around me,

179
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,480
and

180
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,200
so I apologized

181
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,760
if that was

182
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,600
the case, and

183
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,020
told her that

184
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,500
I miss chatting

185
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,960
with her at

186
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,180
work.

187
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,160
The next day

188
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,880
she texted back,

189
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,440
I'm just going

190
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,120
through some shit

191
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,060
right now, and

192
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,260
don't

193
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,660
want to bring

194
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,120
it to work

195
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,520
with me.

196
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,900
OK, no worries.

197
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,300
Everyone has those

198
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,600
times.

199
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,700
I guess she

200
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,280
just needs some

201
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,960
space and will

202
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,720
hopefully chat with

203
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,060
me when she

204
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,420
starts to

205
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,900
feel better.

206
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,780
Well the next

207
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,540
week she was

208
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,380
smiles and roses,

209
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,640
chatting with everyone

210
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,120
in the office,

211
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:30,880
cracking

212
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
jokes and asking

213
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,560
about people's day

214
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,840
today.

215
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,340
Everyone except me.

216
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,420
This went on

217
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,800
for a couple

218
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,420
of days before

219
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,040
I texted, hey.

220
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,140
I feel like

221
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,720
we haven't talked

222
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,100
in forever.

223
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,140
We should grab

224
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,640
a drink and

225
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,080
catch up.

226
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
The next morning

227
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,460
she responded, hey,

228
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm sorry I

229
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,960
can't go out

230
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,340
right now.

231
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,360
And broke OK

232
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,180
maybe next paycheck.

233
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,260
And I asked

234
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,760
again two weeks

235
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,800
later, she responded

236
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,120
quickly.

237
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,300
I'm sorry.

238
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm really not

239
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,960
up for it.

240
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,380
Well shit, I

241
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,840
guess she really

242
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,400
is still going

243
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,820
through it.

244
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,920
I continued to

245
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,440
give her space,

246
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,300
but at the

247
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,640
end of the

248
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,500
week, with her

249
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,200
chatting away with

250
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,900
everyone but me,

251
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,000
I felt like

252
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,440
I needed to

253
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,300
apologize for whatever

254
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,800
I had done.

255
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,760
And so I

256
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
said, I'm sorry

257
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
for sending this

258
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,760
message, and I'm

259
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,420
sorry for whatever

260
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,940
I did to

261
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,060
make

262
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,660
you not want

263
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,140
to talk to

264
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,280
me.

265
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,220
I miss our

266
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,940
friendship and chats.

267
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,120
I know this

268
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,740
message may make

269
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,600
it worse, and

270
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,260
I'm sorry for

271
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,700
that too.

272
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,640
Puzzled.

273
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,760
And sorry you

274
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,320
feel that way.

275
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
I don't feel

276
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,800
the need to

277
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,520
constantly chat at

278
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,760
work.

279
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,720
But I have

280
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,200
to ask you

281
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,940
to stop messaging

282
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,620
me about this

283
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,160
because it puts

284
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,700
me in an

285
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,080
uncomfortable

286
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,720
position.

287
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,620
Ooh.

288
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,740
Oof.

289
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,840
It's my fault,

290
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm sorry.

291
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,400
I must have

292
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,600
mistook friendliness for

293
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
friendship, I replied.

294
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,160
She stopped talking

295
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,580
to me in

296
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,320
any function other

297
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
than work related

298
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
after that day.

299
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,980
Something about what

300
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,580
she said stood

301
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,980
out to me.

302
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,980
I don't feel

303
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,440
the need to

304
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,200
constantly chat the

305
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,420
words.

306
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,620
Repeated in my

307
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,180
mind like a

308
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,680
CD with a

309
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:43,820
skip.

310
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Well, I thought,

311
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,220
I do tend

312
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,800
to chitchat at

313
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,020
work.

314
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,100
I'm a naturally

315
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,980
friendly person.

316
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,680
And tend to

317
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,300
ask questions which

318
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,380
keep conversations alive,

319
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,300
instead of letting

320
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,680
them die.

321
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,700
I guess I

322
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,220
will take you

323
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,680
from her.

324
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,600
I will go

325
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,140
a few weeks

326
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,080
only speaking when

327
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,300
necessary, or when

328
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,900
spoken to.

329
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,320
I guess nobody

330
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,780
at my work

331
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,800
likes me, because

332
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,380
after a week,

333
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,600
I'd had exactly

334
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,540
one person talk

335
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,060
to me outside

336
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,760
of work questions.

337
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,820
I am an

338
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,080
anxious, depressed wreck,

339
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,240
and I'm currently

340
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,100
questioning all my

341
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,740
life's friendships.

342
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,140
Too long didn't

343
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,300
read.

344
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,740
I lost one

345
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,540
work friendship and

346
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,140
decided to check

347
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,600
them all by

348
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,400
only speaking when

349
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,660
spoken

350
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,860
to.

351
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,140
After a week,

352
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,820
I have had

353
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
exactly one conversation

354
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,160
and I'm questioning

355
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,720
my life.
