6
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,580
So today I

7
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,120
was out on

8
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,560
a date with

9
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,100
a girl I've

10
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,540
liked for a

11
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,100
long time.

12
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,180
So I finally

13
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,780
took her out,

14
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,580
and we were

15
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,100
having a great

16
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,820
time until I

17
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,240
took her to

18
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,460
dinner.

19
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,400
We went to

20
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,080
a nice Mexican

21
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,660
place and I

22
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,600
ordered chicken fajitas,

23
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,860
and this is

24
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,220
when it all

25
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,380
went

26
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:16,600
wrong.

27
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,800
I noticed that,

28
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,800
on the side,

29
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,300
there was a

30
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,480
pepper.

31
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,280
I asked, and

32
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,540
it was a

33
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,220
serenoke pepper.

34
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,580
And while trying

35
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,340
to impress her,

36
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,460
I ate almost

37
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,520
the entirety of

38
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:26,860
the pepper.

39
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,120
The spiciest thing

40
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,640
I can handle

41
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,740
is a jalapeno.

42
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,700
So I don't

43
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,200
know why I

44
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,680
thought this was

45
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,260
a good idea.

46
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,940
But anyway, I

47
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,420
took a huge

48
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,380
bite, and tried

49
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,160
to chew, and

50
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,420
swallow.

51
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,620
I swallowed a

52
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,120
tiny bit of

53
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,780
it before almost

54
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,280
throwing up.

55
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,400
I spit it

56
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,900
out in tears

57
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,640
and some snot

58
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,220
rolled down my

59
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,040
face, and I

60
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,400
had to ask

61
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,960
the waiter if

62
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,420
they had milk

63
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,000
I could drink.

64
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,040
I also had

65
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,440
to ask for

66
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,060
my date's water,

67
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:47,980
and I ordered

68
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,640
a sorbet to

69
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,120
help cool my

70
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,280
mouth.

71
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,400
This is either

72
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,980
something we will

73
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,540
laugh about in

74
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,400
five years, or

75
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,280
something she might

76
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,460
not

77
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,780
want to go

78
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,200
out with me

79
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,080
again after crying

80
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,600
from a pepper.

81
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm typing this

82
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,280
up while she

83
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,400
runs to the

84
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,760
bathroom.

85
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,140
So I imagine

86
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,660
when she comes

87
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,820
back, it will

88
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,520
be pretty awkward.

89
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,720
Too long didn't

90
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,160
read I ate

91
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,600
a hot pepper

92
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,020
in front of

93
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,040
my crush, cried

94
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,660
and nearly threw

95
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:06,920
up.

96
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,800
Had to ask

97
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,240
for milk in

98
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,220
a restaurant, and

99
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,820
drunk her water

100
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,300
and had some

101
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,880
ice cream to

102
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,000
help

103
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,400
me cool my

104
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,880
mouth down.

105
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,660
Update

106
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,060
First I would

107
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,520
like to say

108
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,240
thanks for all

109
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,700
the comments, and

110
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:16,960
I hope you

111
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,400
guys got a

112
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,540
good

113
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,260
laugh over my

114
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,600
misfortune, and here's

115
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:19,940
the update.

116
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,460
So yes, she

117
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,080
did eventually come

118
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,340
back.

119
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,220
The rest of

120
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,640
the date went

121
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,540
surprisingly well.

122
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,700
She actually ended

123
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,280
up laughing it

124
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,180
off, and started

125
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,000
making jokes about

126
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,220
it.

127
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,160
When she came

128
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,760
back I said,

129
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
I think I

130
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,900
handled that well,

131
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,000
and she started

132
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,880
laughing hard so

133
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,240
I might have

134
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,880
clutched.

135
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,440
I felt like

136
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:35,820
it was one

137
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,180
of the times

138
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,820
where laughter was

139
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,320
the best medicine

140
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,780
you know.

141
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,760
She was in

142
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,380
the bathroom for

143
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,820
a long enough

144
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,420
time for me

145
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,180
to think that

146
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,620
she might have

147
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,960
texted,

148
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,840
or called a

149
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,100
few people, and

150
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,600
told them about

151
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,800
me.

152
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,780
But she came

153
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,500
back so I'm

154
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,100
hoping she was

155
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,840
always planning on

156
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,140
returning.

157
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,320
Anyway I dropped

158
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,720
her off in

159
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,160
about an hour

160
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,140
later, she texted

161
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,680
me a picture

162
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,080
of a glass

163
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,420
of milk.

164
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
After that she's

165
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,940
a keeper, so

166
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm gonna ask

167
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,840
her out again

168
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,180
tomorrow.

169
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,100
So wish me

170
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,320
luck.
