1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
Today I f**ked

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,300
out wandered onto

3
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,000
a US Army

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,300
military base as

5
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,040
foreigners looking for

6
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,340
a pool.

7
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,500
So this happened

8
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,540
earlier last week,

9
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,540
and for habit

10
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,800
of context, my

11
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,280
buddy and I

12
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,560
are both

13
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,540
Canadians and had

14
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,700
graduated from university

15
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,480
earlier this month.

16
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,660
We decided for

17
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,500
a celebratory road

18
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,540
trip, we would

19
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,340
drive from BC,

20
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,260
where we're from,

21
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:17,920
down

22
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,260
to California, Arizona,

23
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,720
New Mexico, Texas,

24
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,340
and eventually Louisiana

25
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,460
before belining it

26
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,120
back to Canada

27
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,620
for work.

28
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,520
So by this

29
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,120
point, we're a

30
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,640
few days in

31
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,240
and arrived in

32
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,980
El Paso, Texas.

33
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,220
We decided we'd

34
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,760
walk down to

35
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,300
Cui D'Aures

36
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,840
just to check

37
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,460
things out after

38
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:31,840
watching the

39
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,000
movie Sicario, and

40
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,460
the day before,

41
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,560
we visited White

42
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Sands, New Mexico.

43
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,180
After returning from

44
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,500
Juarez.

45
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,760
It was past

46
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,820
noon already, and

47
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,260
we felt like

48
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,780
we're being roasted

49
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,420
alive in the

50
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,000
Texas heat,

51
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,140
and figured we'd

52
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,900
cool ourselves down

53
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,280
at a local

54
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,980
community pool.

55
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,020
I searched up

56
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,440
some pretty good

57
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,300
pools online and

58
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,800
set the GPS

59
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
waypoint to the

60
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,360
closest one.

61
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,680
The directions told

62
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,020
me it was

63
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,960
located right after

64
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,540
a right turn

65
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,260
from the highway

66
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,720
off ramp.

67
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
And as I

68
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,460
make the turn,

69
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,360
I realized we

70
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,120
had ventured onto

71
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,900
a US Army

72
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,480
military base, Fort

73
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,760
Bliss,

74
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,940
home to the

75
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,940
first armored division.

76
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,940
I tell my

77
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,500
buddy we should

78
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:03,980
just make a

79
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,800
U-turn and

80
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,280
get out of

81
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,820
there before we

82
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,360
went in too

83
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,820
deep to the

84
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,000
gates.

85
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,380
He says, let's

86
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,220
just try anyways.

87
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,400
And boy was

88
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,020
that a terrible

89
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,400
decision.

90
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,360
As we pull

91
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,820
up, I tell

92
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,700
the military personnel

93
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,100
our mistake, and

94
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,640
show him our

95
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,340
only available

96
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,040
form of ID,

97
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,880
Canadian passports, etc.

98
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,940
He says they'll

99
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,320
just take a

100
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,740
look at those

101
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,200
and have us

102
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,520
on our way

103
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,100
very soon.

104
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,620
That was the

105
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,160
biggest understatement I've

106
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,740
ever heard.

107
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,700
They ended up

108
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,300
closing the lane

109
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,780
I was on,

110
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,740
and I knew

111
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,240
we were in

112
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,800
for a long

113
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,120
ride.

114
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,980
Shortly after, a

115
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,780
pair of MPs

116
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,900
show up, military

117
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,380
police, and started

118
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,180
questioning us and

119
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,560
had us

120
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,740
filled detailed forms.

121
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,020
They basically mapped

122
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,700
out and pieced

123
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,520
together our entire

124
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,820
trip plan, personal

125
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,260
background,

126
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,360
and where we

127
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,160
were before then.

128
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,140
When they heard

129
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,840
we went to

130
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,740
Juarez earlier in

131
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,020
the day.

132
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,380
They asked for

133
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,420
screenshots of hotel

134
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,600
reservations we made

135
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,340
in El Paso,

136
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,400
and kept asking

137
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,700
if we

138
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,340
spoke more than

139
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,800
one language, Spanish,

140
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,640
specifically.

141
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,720
Before I knew

142
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
it, four additional

143
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
army investigators in

144
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,100
civilian attire showed

145
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,980
up, and from

146
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,220
there

147
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,720
they took our

148
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,100
photos.

149
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,580
Mugshot style, photos

150
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,160
of my car,

151
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,320
conducted a search

152
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,960
on my car,

153
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,000
and even went

154
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,520
to photograph

155
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
every single page

156
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,120
of my car's

157
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,700
registration papers, before

158
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,340
going through both

159
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,740
my buddy

160
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,320
and I's phones,

161
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,620
and laptop photos,

162
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,500
and messages.

163
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,040
The entire process

164
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,720
took over two

165
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,560
hours before they

166
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,460
cleared us, and

167
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,920
sent us on

168
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,220
our way.

169
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,920
At most, there

170
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,560
were 12 army

171
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,540
personnel around us

172
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,940
at the gates

173
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,400
and peas, investigators,

174
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,080
army people, dealing

175
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,500
with the shit

176
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,140
storm we stirred.

177
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,220
The MPs were

178
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,240
really nice, and

179
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,820
we chatted with

180
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,440
them quite abbot,

181
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,060
but honestly, one

182
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,200
of the

183
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
craziest experiences of

184
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,840
my life.

185
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,920
Too long didn't

186
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,120
read.

187
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,380
My buddy and

188
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,200
I wandered onto

189
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,960
a US military

190
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
base by accident,

191
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,140
looking for a

192
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,860
pool as foreigners,

193
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,240
and we're interrogated

194
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,900
for two hours

195
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,920
before allowing us

196
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,380
to you turn

197
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,820
out of the

198
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,060
base.
