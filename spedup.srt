1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Am I the asshole for yelling at my sister that my wedding is not her wedding?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,160
I. 29F.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
I'm planning my wedding for September of this year.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,560
It's the end of summer and also the month I met my fiancé.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,200
My sister, Kat.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,480
33F, was supposed to get married five years ago, but her partner died in a motorcycle accident.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,440
She was devastated and had a hard time.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,040
Since then, she's been very gloomy and her relationships don't last long.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,200
She goes to therapy on and off.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,360
When I told my family that I was getting married, Kat was visibly sad.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,400
So my mom asked me to involve her in the planning and ask for her opinion to make her feel part.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,480
A bit, however, she didn't agree with my choice of September.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Thinking it's a bad month for a wedding.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
She also didn't like the colors I picked or the dress I wanted.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,240
I tried to listen to her sometimes.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,520
At one point, she said, I can't believe you'll be the first daughter, my.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,160
Not our father is going to walk down the aisle.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,920
I was gutted by her comment.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm not having a religious ceremony.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,000
My fiancé's best friend got a license to officiate our marriage.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
So it's not that serious.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
With that in mind, I'm planning the wedding to reflect our personalities.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
My best friend suggested that the bridesmaids wear different colored dresses.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
But my sister didn't agree.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
She made some comments like, it'll look like a gay pride parade, and you're turning

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,520
your wedding into a gay wedding by.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Turning to all your of friend's suggestions.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,240
Yes, my best friend is gay.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,120
But we have similar tastes.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,720
So his opinions are highly valued because they match mine.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,000
Last week, we were organizing the entrance of our bridesmaids and best men.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,960
In our culture, we call them, godfathers, godmothers, and they enter together.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,440
I told her that my best friend would enter with his boyfriend.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,200
My sister then said my wedding was going to be, an absolute circus, and that.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,480
As my older sister, she should make me see reason.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,560
She insisted that two men shouldn't enter the ceremony together because not all guests

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
would.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
Understand and appreciate it.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Her comments were very annoying and homophobic.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,680
She continued with her remarks and even called my fiancé to get his opinion.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,240
At some point, I was fed up and yelled, you're out of line because this is my wedding and

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,760
not yours.

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,960
Have your own wedding and plan it as you want.

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
I was very angry.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
And my mom came from the garden to see what was happening.

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
Kat started crying and went to her room.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,520
It's been five days.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,800
And she's giving me the silent treatment.

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
She told my mom that she won't be attending my wedding.

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
It's very annoying.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,200
She tries to make me feel uncomfortable.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
For example, if she's in the kitchen and I enter, she leaves.

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,120
Yesterday, my mom said I should apologize because my sister is fragile and this topic makes

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,280
her suffer.

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,480
However, I don't think I'm that much of an asshole.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,400
My mom said that yelling at her was an asshole move.

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Even if I was right.
