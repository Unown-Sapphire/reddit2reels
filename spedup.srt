6
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,140
Okay, so about

7
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,040
two years ago

8
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,840
my mother died.

9
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,940
When she died

10
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,420
she left a

11
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,160
trust fund for

12
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,540
me and my

13
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,000
four siblings.

14
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,260
We are each

15
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,020
supposed to be

16
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,440
receiving 20,000

17
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,920
per year.

18
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,840
It is all

19
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,300
put on one

20
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,100
account then supposed

21
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,680
to be split

22
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,440
up, and my

23
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,120
grandma is supposed

24
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,840
to handle it.

25
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,120
Her favorite grandchild

26
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,820
has always been

27
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,680
my oldest sister,

28
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,000
for many reasons.

29
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,380
But I didn't

30
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,040
expect this to

31
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,580
go this far.

32
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,740
My sister was

33
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,200
raised by my

34
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,940
grandmother and didn't

35
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,320
live with us

36
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,720
for most of

37
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,180
our lives.

38
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,240
So she was

39
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,780
the least close

40
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,360
with my mom.

41
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,400
Within the first

42
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,880
year of the

43
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,020
trust fund, we

44
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,500
find out she

45
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,580
is getting 50%.

46
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,620
While me and

47
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,220
my other siblings

48
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,900
are splitting the

49
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,980
other 50%.

50
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,820
She also spent

51
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,100
35,000 extra

52
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,680
on other things

53
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,560
including pain for

54
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,300
her apartment in

55
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,680
Upper East

56
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,240
Side Manhattan.

57
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,340
And going to

58
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,960
stunt school in

59
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Atlanta, while still

60
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,460
paying for the

61
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,700
apartment, in ACA.

62
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,800
She also has

63
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,260
gone on many

64
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,400
shopping sprees, and

65
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,880
opted in with

66
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,320
the money from

67
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,600
the trust

68
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,380
that isn't rightfully

69
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,620
hers.

70
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,640
It is her

71
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,220
fault in my

72
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,540
grandma's, but am

73
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,040
I wrong for

74
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,740
expecting her to

75
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,200
pay it back?

76
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,440
I'm not sure

77
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,980
how I should

78
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,700
go about this,

79
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,480
and if I

80
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,040
should ask for

81
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,580
the money back.
