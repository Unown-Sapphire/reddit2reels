1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
Am I the

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,880
asshole for not

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,380
going back to

4
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,960
a cafe after

5
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,560
they accused me

6
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,940
of being a

7
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,100
creep?

8
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,580
I... 31em.

9
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,820
Used to be

10
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,440
a regular at

11
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,960
a cafe in

12
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,420
my neighborhood.

13
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,400
It became a

14
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,860
habit to go

15
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,440
down there every

16
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,160
Saturday just to

17
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,660
have a coffee.

18
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,560
Listen to a

19
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,020
book and play

20
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,460
games on my

21
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:13,900
phone for a

22
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:13,980
bit.

23
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,120
I later learned

24
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,480
it was an

25
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,280
old schoolmate of

26
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,900
mine from 20

27
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,500
years ago that

28
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,160
owns the place,

29
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,740
so I reconnected

30
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,160
with him as

31
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,380
well.

32
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,160
Fast forward, hum

33
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,220
six months, and

34
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,500
I get a

35
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,080
message from the

36
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,700
owner saying that

37
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,000
he'd gotten

38
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,760
complaints from an

39
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,640
employee about me.

40
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,880
That I'm harassing

41
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,920
ogling her and

42
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,340
that she feels

43
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,300
unsafe when I'm

44
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,500
there.

45
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,580
And that she

46
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,780
says, I only

47
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,380
come there when

48
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,940
she's working.

49
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,060
He said he's

50
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,020
sorry, but he

51
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,380
needs to look

52
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,780
out for his

53
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,040
employees and ask

54
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,460
that I don't

55
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,640
come

56
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,140
there anymore.

57
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,260
This came just

58
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,640
out of the

59
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,220
blue for me.

60
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,240
I never flirt

61
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,760
or stare at

62
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,240
anyone there.

63
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,520
I never interact

64
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,220
with the employees

65
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,980
at all apart

66
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,640
from ordering and

67
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:46,840
paying.

68
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,300
Convo, is usually...

69
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,600
hello?

70
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,500
Hello?

71
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,400
The usual?

72
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,580
Yes please.

73
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,900
That'll be X

74
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,080
amount.

75
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,160
Thanks.

76
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Thanks.

77
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,180
That's it.

78
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm in.

79
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,220
In sin?

80
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,020
Doth.

81
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,680
After that, I

82
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,300
just sit and

83
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,780
stare at my

84
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,480
phone for 30

85
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,740
minutes.

86
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,840
If I'm in

87
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,540
my favorite spot,

88
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,860
I can't even

89
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,380
see the counter.

90
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,480
I answered him

91
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,920
that none of

92
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,380
that is true

93
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,060
and I go

94
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,000
there on Saturdays.

95
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,940
We went back

96
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,500
and forth for

97
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,420
a while, and

98
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,800
I got so

99
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,400
pissed that I

100
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,880
made a record

101
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,320
of all the

102
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,920
payments to that

103
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,020
place going all

104
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,500
the way back

105
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,980
to an A

106
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,160
opened.

107
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,500
This worked better

108
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,280
than expected since

109
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,780
he could see

110
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,160
I had been

111
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,680
going there on

112
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,260
Saturdays

113
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,360
since before she

114
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,780
was hired.

115
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,720
A few days

116
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,340
later, he wrote

117
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,840
to me again

118
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,420
and said she'd

119
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,400
been offered and

120
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,060
had accepted another

121
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,600
shift, so she

122
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,060
wouldn't have to

123
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,780
see me and

124
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,080
that I was

125
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,540
welcome again.

126
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,540
I just said

127
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:32,900
that I was

128
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,640
never coming back

129
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,360
after all this.

130
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,400
There was some

131
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,940
more back and

132
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,840
forth, and he

133
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,760
basically called me

134
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
an asshole for

135
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,440
not returning

136
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,080
after he fixed

137
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,520
the problem.

138
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,460
Am I the

139
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,140
asshole for not

140
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,760
wanting to go

141
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,320
back there?

142
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,380
Even though I

143
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,860
wouldn't have to

144
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,460
see her again.
