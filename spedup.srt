00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Today I fucked up, hitting my head on the bottom of a pool.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,600
Today I fucked up.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,400
Okay it was actually on Monday hope that's okay.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,680
By hitting my face, head hard on the bottom of a pool.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,360
Even worse, my seven-year-old, who can barely swim.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,600
And I were completely alone at the pool.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,520
We were messing around in the shallow end where he can touch the bottom and I wanted to show off.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,440
Some of my dumb pool moves.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,000
I backed up into deeper water and jumped into a back flip.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,160
I didn't go deep enough and smashed my face into the bottom of the pool.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
It hurt.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,440
But I was super lucky.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
It didn't occur to me until later on how bad that could have been.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,440
If I had been a little shallower or jumped a little harder I could have gotten knocked

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,960
unconscious.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Or have a spinal cord injury.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,160
Luckily my brow and chin were the only spots that made contact and I just have some black

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
and blue.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,800
Bruises and a scraped.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,440
There is no doubt in my mind my kid would come and try to save me.

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,680
He could go too deep and we'd both drown.

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,560
I asked what he would do and he said he'd save me and then call 991.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,920
I tried calling 991 and it doesn't even root you to 911.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm showing him how to access emergency services on my iPhone and I'm never going to do stupid

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
shit.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,800
Like that again, to make matters worse, I think my old 40-year-old self may have hyper extended

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,000
my back.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm having rib pain by my spine.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,280
It's constant and throbbing and has gotten worse by the day.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
I haven't yet sought out medical care but if it doesn't improve in the next few days

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,200
I will.

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Please roast me for being such an idiot.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
Too long didn't read.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I hit my head on the bottom of the pool while alone with my seven-year-old son who can

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,080
barely swim.

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,280
Now have a back injury.
