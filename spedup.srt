7
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,340
This happened just

8
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:05,800
a few hours

9
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,760
ago, and I'm

10
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,260
still trying to

11
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,840
recover from the

12
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,320
embarrassment

13
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,800
and pain.

14
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,100
So my parents

15
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,660
and I decided

16
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,100
to take a

17
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,720
road trip to

18
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,520
my grandmother's in

19
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,180
Niagara Falls.

20
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,700
So we're cruising

21
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,260
down the highway.

22
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,340
And I'm in

23
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,100
the backseat enjoying

24
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,760
my nice hot

25
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
McDonald's black coffee.

26
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,400
Now, let me

27
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,900
set the scene.

28
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,920
We're all talking

29
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,660
and joking around,

30
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,460
having a great

31
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:23,740
time.

32
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,680
I reached out

33
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,080
and grabbed my

34
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,560
phone from the

35
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:25,920
floor of the

36
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,120
car.

37
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,840
And in the

38
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
process, my elbow

39
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,940
somehow knocks my

40
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,820
cup right into

41
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,360
my lap.

42
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,280
The lid pops

43
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,400
off and scalding

44
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,060
hot coffee spills

45
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,600
all over my

46
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,000
crotch.

47
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,740
Instantly, I go

48
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,420
from laughing to

49
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,520
screaming bloody murder.

50
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,920
My parents slam

51
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,440
on the brakes,

52
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,440
thinking we've hit

53
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,040
something or that

54
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm having a

55
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:41,820
medical

56
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,360
emergency.

57
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,880
I'm flailing around,

58
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,080
trying to undo

59
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,320
my seatbelt, and

60
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,860
trying not to

61
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,260
make a bigger

62
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,620
mess in

63
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:47,900
the car.

64
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,680
Finally, they pull

65
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
over, and I

66
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,320
stumble out of

67
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,240
the car, half

68
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,140
in pain, and

69
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,900
half in embarrassment.

70
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,080
I managed to

71
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,580
peel off my

72
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,340
jeans and boxes

73
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,020
right there on

74
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,440
the side of

75
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:57,720
the road.

76
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,760
While my parents

77
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,540
are alternating between

78
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,520
concerned and trying

79
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,120
not to laugh.

80
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,980
Meanwhile, I'm desperately

81
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,700
trying to cool

82
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,220
down the burns

83
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,860
with water from

84
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,280
our cooler,

85
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,140
feeling like the

86
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,040
world's biggest idiot.

87
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,180
After what feels

88
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,900
like an eternity

89
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,100
of roadside humiliation,

90
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,480
I managed to

91
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,280
clean myself up

92
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,840
as best as

93
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,920
I can, and

94
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,440
get back into

95
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,800
the car.

96
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,080
Needless to say,

97
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,000
the rest of

98
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,520
the road trip

99
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,100
was a lot

100
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,260
quieter, as I

101
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,080
sat there nursing

102
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,340
my

103
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,980
wounded pride.

104
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,160
And even more

105
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,020
wounded privates.

106
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,060
Lesson learned.

107
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,120
Always make sure

108
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,440
you're lit a

109
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,820
securely fastened, especially

110
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,200
when you're on

111
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,800
a bumpy road

112
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,060
trip.

113
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,000
Too long to

114
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,240
read.

115
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,320
Try to enjoy

116
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,940
coffee on a

117
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,340
road trip.

118
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,380
Ended up with

119
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,940
burns on my

120
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,760
nether regions and

121
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,380
a story I'll

122
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,160
never live down

123
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,900
with my parents.

124
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,260
I'm sticking to

125
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,960
iced from now

126
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,280
on.

127
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,340
I couldn't stop

128
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
myself from laughing

129
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,740
writing this.

130
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,860
I am literally

131
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,680
wheezing both in

132
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,620
pain, and how

133
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,120
funny the whole

134
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
situation is.
