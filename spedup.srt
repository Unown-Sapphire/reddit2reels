6
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,920
Okay so, I

7
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,620
am 14 years

8
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,560
old and obviously

9
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:06,860
a girl.

10
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,060
Today whilst I

11
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,400
was in my

12
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,180
neighborhood park I

13
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,540
saw a group

14
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,060
of high school

15
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,040
boys playing football.

16
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,180
Not unusual.

17
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,500
So whilst I

18
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,160
was walking one

19
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,500
of them that

20
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,120
I kinda know

21
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,480
yelled,

22
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,360
Hey name, you're

23
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,040
14 right?

24
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,000
So I was

25
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,700
obviously like,

26
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,660
Yeah, because I

27
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:21,980
am in fact

28
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,480
14.

29
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,580
So he tells

30
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,020
me that his

31
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,620
friend said that

32
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,080
I'm sexy,

33
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,060
and that his

34
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,840
friend wants my

35
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,100
number.

36
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,360
I just kinda

37
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,060
laughed it off

38
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,600
because it's not

39
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,580
that serious, just

40
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,280
a little creepy.

41
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,300
So I walked

42
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,960
around again since

43
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,400
I was waiting

44
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,880
for my friend

45
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,320
to arrive,

46
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,380
and the same

47
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:37,960
guy called me

48
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,360
over to the

49
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,880
group of boys.

50
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,220
So I walked

51
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,500
over.

52
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,540
The guy asks

53
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:41,980
me to get

54
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,540
his friend my

55
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,700
number, and I

56
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,420
obviously said,

57
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,320
No, thank you.

58
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,360
So whilst I

59
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,880
was like turned

60
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,860
around walking back

61
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,540
to the concrete

62
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,080
part of the

63
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,380
park,

64
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,360
one of the

65
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,160
boys yells to

66
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,900
me that the

67
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,440
boy who liked

68
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,420
me said he

69
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,200
wanted to say

70
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,400
me.

71
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,320
I just ignored

72
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
it because again,

73
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,540
it's not that

74
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,940
big of a

75
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,200
deal.

76
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,020
So they go

77
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,380
back to their

78
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,020
friend's house I

79
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,520
assume I get

80
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,940
a call from

81
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,560
a random number

82
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,040
on my phone.

83
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,340
It wasn't labeled

84
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,900
as a scam,

85
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,600
so I picked

86
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,900
it up.

87
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,940
It was basically

88
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,440
just the guy

89
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,140
asking me to

90
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,920
replace his girlfriend.

91
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,900
So I decided
92
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,380
to ask him
93
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:11,680
if he was
94
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,880
too.
95
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,160
Restarted to know
96
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,800
I can block
97
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,300
your number.
98
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,180
Zo-o apparently
99
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,100
he was actually
100
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,060
an artist, which
101
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,040
I didn't know.
102
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,020
I just thought
103
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,540
he was regular
104
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,340
stupid and not
105
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,160
actually impaired.
106
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,080
I don't feel
107
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,760
too bad though.
108
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,160
Ah, it's just
109
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,020
a little exploited
110
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,840
because apparently he
111
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,240
has a plan
112
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,000
to actually assault
113
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,280
me.
114
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,480
Too long didn't
115
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,220
read I think
116
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,920
I accidentally had
117
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,320
to find a
118
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,600
boy.
