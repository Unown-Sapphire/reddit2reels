00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Today I fucked up by changing gas suppliers which resulted in me paying for electricity for theâ€”first

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,920
time in 11 years. This story starts in 2013. I bought a new house in Pennsylvania and signed

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,600
up for utilities with a local company that combines. Both electric and gas in one bill.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,440
I set up auto pace I automatically pay bills without even looking at them. As the years go by,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,160
I never look at the actual bill. Only once in a while I'm bewildered how cheap my gas and

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,640
electricity bill is. Averaging about $65 per month. Maybe two months ago I was talking to my

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,160
sister who lives nearby about it and she couldn't believe. It either, needless to say I didn't dig

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,440
deeper and went on my merry way. Maybe a few days afterwards I was shopping in Walmart and there

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,920
was a representative of a competing. Gas company offering a $15 Walmart gift card for switching my gas

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,880
supplier. I told him that I don't use much gas anyway so the savings would be minimal but

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,320
extra $15 to. Spend at Walmart never heard anyone. Famous last words. He even tells me that I have

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,920
three days to change my mind before they actually switch me and then I have another three months to cancel

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,640
if I'm not happy. I got my $15 gift right after I finished the sign-up process. Today I get an email

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,000
from my gas and electric company with a much higher total than normal. For the first time I actually

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
look at my bill and compare it to my previous bills and that's when I see it. Before the switch

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,360
to a new gas supplier I never paid for any electricity. I guess the change in my gas supplier made them

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,360
rejig the entire account and they finally started. Counting my electricity usage. My bill is now

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,040
$100 higher than before. For 11 years I was blissfully unaware that I had free electricity.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
I immediately called the new gas supplier and canceled their service but I'm sure that the

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,560
Kraken is out and I'll have to pay for electricity from now on. Because I never paid for electricity

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't even know much much this fuck up is going to cost me in the long run. Fortunately I'm moving

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,160
in a year so the damage will be limited. But still, TL, DR, I exchanged a $15 Walmart gift card to pay extra

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
$1000 plus per year.
